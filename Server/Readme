Still WIP!

Please note that I am not professional programmer, nor I haven't had any courses with C++. All code made by me is in main file, shattered to smaller functions, but there are no seperate classes etc.

To do:

-Checking for invalid characters in name (Done partly)
	- Checking names from messages
-Proper measures when chatter array is full
-Admin commands (kick, showing connected clients etc.)
-More security and more stable
