Small chat program.
This program will have server and multiplatform client. 
GNU/Linux is the target OS.

Server directory has the server software,
Geeklient directory has current client software and
Geeklient_Python directory has old and obsolete Python version of the client

Our C and C++ skills are quite minimal right now, but we're doing this 
program to improve them.
